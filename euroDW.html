                    <h1 class="section-heading">Overview</h1>
                    <p>
                     The 18th EuroSys Doctoral Workshop (EuroDW '24) will provide a forum for PhD students to present
                     their work and receive constructive feedback from experts in the field, as well as from peers.
                     Technical presentations will be augmented with general advice and discussions about getting a PhD,
                     doing research, and career perspectives. EuroDW '24 will also offer the opportunity for mentoring.
                     The idea is to give graduate students a chance to talk one-on-one (or, in some cases, one-on-two)
                     about their research with outstanding researchers beyond those available at the studentsâ€™ universities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            We invite applications from PhD students at any stage of their doctoral studies.
                            Historically, the doctoral workshop has been helpful for both junior and senior students.
                        </strong>
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Workshop Format</h2>
                    <p>
                        This year, the workshop will take place in an in-person format.
		  We look forward to seeing you in Athens, during <a href=".">EuroSys 2024</a>.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Goal of the Workshop</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal of the workshop is to provide feedback and advice to PhD students both on technical aspects of their research
                        as well as career development. We expect a range of participants such as the presenters' peers, as well as
                        senior researchers who will attend to share their expertise and provide constructive feedback.
                        The idea is to create opportunities for students to meet with peers outside of their home institution, to get technical feedback
                        as well as career advice from senior researchers in their field, to find out about internship and job opportunities,
                        and to articulate their own work in a public, non-threatening forum. We encourage the participants to stay for the
                  duration of the EuroSys main conference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We expect most submissions to be from current PhD students who have selected a clear research topic. Research topics of
                        interest cover computing systems in the broadest sense, including work on formal foundations, as well as the design,
                        implementation and evaluation of real systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More specifically, research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Operating systems</li>
                            <li>Distributed systems</li>
                            <li>Cloud computing and datacenter systems</li>
                            <li>File and storage systems</li>
                            <li>Networked systems</li>
                            <li>Language support and runtime systems</li>
                            <li>Systems security and privacy</li>

                            <li>Analysis, testing and verification of systems</li>
                            <li>Database systems and data analytics frameworks</li>
                            <li>Virtualization and virtualized systems</li>
                            <li>Systems for machine learning/machine learning for systems</li>
                            <li>Mobile and pervasive systems</li>
                            <li>Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems</li>
                            <li>Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems</li>
                            <li>Systems for emerging hardware</li>

                        </ul>
